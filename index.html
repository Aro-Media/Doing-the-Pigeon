    <h1>Welcome to the official Pigeon Convention website!</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>Hosted every year in Peoria by local organization Agilao since 1973, the pigeon convention <br> is a chance for pigeon lovers around the world to connect with fellow enthusiasts.</h3>
    <p>We are dedicated to keeping this tradition alive by working with a number of sponsors, ensuring each convention <br> is bigger than the last!</p>
    <h3>Our Sponsors include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>DIA Pie Manufacturing Co.</li>
        <li>Walce Flower Foundation</li>
        <li>Broadcasting National News</li>
        <li>Bird Sanctuaries United</li>
        <li>Some random pharmaceutical company literally no one knows about</li>
        <li>Company from Foreign Country</li>
        <li>And <em>nearly 50 more!</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Here at Agilao, Our values are simple.</h2>
    <p>Our mission is to bring awareness to underappreciated animals. Yep, that's it. For example, everyone loves Ravens. <br> They're considered cool, and smart. Pigeons, however, get a much worse reputation - despite being just as smart.</p>
    <p>We at Agilao wanted to give Pigeons a bit of a spotlight, and so in 1971, our founder Marth Na-Clo made the first <br> at the Pigeon Convention. Although he only managed to get 1 person to come, that one person was Roy Cal-Oxi,<br>Agilao's Co-founder. Together, they took '72 off to make some big changes, and by 1973, we had the pigeon <br> convention as you know today!</p>
